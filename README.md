# Chat Filter Bot
### A Chat filteration bot for Discord servers.   
###### V : 2.0.1
Concept : There are certain ban words within different servers, of course there are many other bots that does word filteration throughout texts but there are certain times when the bot cannot understand fancy combinations of the same word. The goal of this bot is to filter out any combinations of these words. 

#### Syntax : &

### Available commands to the date - 

>&wfilter : To display all the contents in the filter list.  
&wfadd : To add a new word to the list.  
&wfdelete : To delete a word from the list.  
&wfclear : To clear a word from the list. 


>####What the bot does as of now:
- Add/Remove words to the list.
- Monitor words sent to the server. 
- Deletes word if there is a banned word in the message.
  - Additionally, the bot mentions/tags the user about bannned word usage.
