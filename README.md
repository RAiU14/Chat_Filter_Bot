# Chat Filter Bot
### A Chat filteration bot for Discord servers.   
###### V : 3.1.1
Concept : There are certain ban words within different servers, of course there are many other bots that does word filteration throughout texts but there are certain times when the bot cannot understand fancy combinations of the same word. The goal of this bot is to filter out any combinations of these words.
